The goal of Jade is to provide a suite of tools to enable the creation of truly peer-to-peer applications on top of EVM-based blockchains like Ethereum Classic.

This is an open source repository in its original condition. It leverages Typescript React, and [Jade](https://jade.builders) to give a good starting point for new and existing projects for peer-to-peer decentralized applications.

Pristine Typescript React Jade is a fork of [etclabscore/pristine-typescript-react](https://github.com/etclabscore/pristine-typescript-react).

There are a lack of repositories to start from to build community driven open source projects. Pristine Typescript React Jade is a complete starting point, it follows a Documentation Driven Development approach, and can be used as a resource to augment existing documentation.

## Documentation Driven Development

There are many ways to drive open source development. Documenting the problem in the README gives a middle ground between technical and non-technical specifications. This allows organizing solutions to this challenge around community and documentation.

> [...] a beautifully crafted library with no documentation is also damn near worthless. If your software solves the wrong problem or nobody can figure out how to use it, thereâ€™s something very bad going on.

Using conventions, documentation and specifications make it easier to:
- communicate the problem you are solving
- ease onboarding
